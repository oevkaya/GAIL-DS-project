# Overview

This folder contains the core code for the GAIL project. The design was intended to 
be relatively modular so that new data science questions can be trained or 
implemented by the LLM agents. We provide a brief overview of each of the folders/classes:

- dm: The data manager works on filtering questions for each dataset
- utils: Contains the utility files for each dataset
- scripts: Contains the scripts to run all simulation experiments. 


and the file of params for loading the set of DS questions.
