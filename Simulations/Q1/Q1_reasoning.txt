First, let's examine the contents of the uploaded file to determine the structure and data it contains. After that, we'll identify how many tourist attractions are listed in the dataset. Let's start by loading and inspecting the file.
It seems there's an issue with reading the file. This could be due to several reasons, including an incorrect file format. Let's check to ensure the file is indeed an Excel file and determine the correct way to read it.

I'll first attempt to identify the file type and then try reading it again.
It seems that the file type can't be determined using mimetypes. To proceed, I'll attempt to read it as a CSV file, as it's a common format that can sometimes be mislabeled. If this fails, I'll check for any specific patterns in the file content. Let's give it a try.
The file was successfully read as a CSV. Here is a preview of the dataset:

- **attraction**: Name of the tourist attraction
- **n_2021**: Number of visitors in 2021
- **n_2022**: Number of visitors in 2022
- **admission**: Type of admission
- **setting**: The setting of the attraction
- **region**: Region where the attraction is located

To determine the number of tourist attractions, we simply need to count the unique entries in the "attraction" column. Let's count them.
There are 348 unique tourist attractions in the dataset. Here is the Python code used to determine this:
