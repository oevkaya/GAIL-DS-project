However, the median completion time is lower for females, indicating that more than half of the female runners finished faster than the median male runner.\n\n2. **5K Event**:\n   - Similarly, females tend to have faster median completion times in the 5K event as well. The spread of times for males is broader, suggesting greater variation in their times compared to females.\n\n### Interpretation:\n- Across both events, female runners have achieved faster median times, suggesting a possible trend of higher performance in terms of completion speed among the female participants.\n- The variation and differences in the spread indicate that while some male participants match or exceed female performance, there's generally a larger group of male participants taking longer to complete the races.\n\nBelow is the complete Python code snippet used to generate the visualization:\n\n\n\nYou can use this snippet by replacing `'/path/to/your/dataset.csv'` with the path to your data file to replicate the visualization."], "outcome": null, "input_words": 253, "input_tokens": 46, "input_tokens_gpt_4o_mini": 46, "GT": [], "verbosity_ratio_words": 0.6067146282973621, "verbosity_ratio_tokens": 0.07098765432098765, "CR": 1, "Similarity_Jaccard": 0.8285714285714286}
