Let's create a dot plot of these employment trends. Afterward, I'll also create a different style plot based on your requests, and later we'll enhance the chosen style plot with improved labels and other components.First, let's start with a dot plot: ### Dot PlotThe dot plot above successfully visualizes the trends in instructional staff employment over time. Now, let's create a different style of plot for this data to provide an alternative visualization. We'll use a filled area plot for this purpose.### Filled Area Plot### Improved PlotFor the final plot, we'll enhance the filled area plot by fixing up its labels, title, and possibly improving other components that could benefit from enhancements, like color contrast, legend placement, and overall readability. It seems there was a minor oversight with handling non-numeric data while calculating the base for the stacked area plot. Let me correct that and attempt to generate the filled area plot again. It seems there was an error related to data types while attempting to convert values. Let me try one more run on the plot generation using defensive programming to ensure all values are correctly interpreted as floats. I apologize for the inconvenience. The persistent error indicates there may be issues with non-numeric data types or missing values in our dataset. Let's perform a thorough check and cleaning of the dataset to resolve the issues and produce the plot without any errors. The dataset columns are assigned appropriate data types, with `faculty_type` as an object (string) and year columns as floats, which should be suitable for plotting. Let's attempt a simple line plot as an alternative while ensuring the data conversion is explicitly handled to prevent errors. Following this, the plan is to seqentially verify all solutions. The `line plot` successfully displays the instructional staff employment trends. This alternative provides a clear view of changes over time with improved labels and visualization quality. ### Summary of What We Did:1. **Dot Plot**: Initially plotted the trends using a dot plot style.2. **Filled Area Plot**: Attempted to visualize using a filled area plot but encountered data-type issues.3. **Improved Labels and Readability**: For the line plot, we followed principles to enhance label clarity, gridlines, titles, and legend for improved readability.If any other specific visualization style or further adjustments are needed, let me know!", "status": "completed", "runtime": 86.633, "input_words": 180, "input_tokens_gpt_4o": 35, "input_tokens_gpt_4.1_mini": 36, "input_tokens_gpt_4.1_nano": 36, "common_answers": [["staff_employment_trends_line_plot_custom", "??"]], "file_name": "instructional-staff.csv", "concepts": ["Data Visualization-Customization"], "level": "medium", "verbosity_ratio_words": 0.3345724907063197, "verbosity_ratio_tokens": 0.04755434782608696, "complete_ratio": 1, "accuracy": null, "auto_image": 1, "require_image": 1, "Similarity_Jaccard": 0.8166666666666667, "code_execute": 1, "code_error": "name 'data' is not defined"}

Here's how we can proceed with plotting the trends:### Dot Plot:Let's start with creating a dot plot showing employment trends for the different categories of instructional staff from 1975 to 2011.### Updated Plot:We'll then create a different style plot (such as a line plot) to visualize the same data and enhance it by adding various visual elements like titles, axis labels, and a legend.Let's implement these steps. The above code creates two types of plots to visualize instructional staff employment trends over time:1. **Dot Plot**: Displays the employment percentages for different categories on a scatter plot, helping to identify trends and distinctions between faculty types at given years.2. **Line Plot**: Connects data points for each category with a line. It enhances the visualization by clearly showing the trend over time for each faculty type, and includes improved labels for clarity.These visualizations provide insights into how the employment distribution among various instructional staff categories has changed from 1975 to 2011.Here's a summary of the results:```json{  \"outcome\": [\"Two plots were generated: a dot plot and a line plot representing instructional staff employment trends from 1975 to 2011.

The columns are:- `faculty_type`: Describes the type of faculty (e.g., Full-Time Tenured Faculty, Part-Time Faculty, etc.)- The remaining columns represent years, from 1975 to 2011, and the values are the employment percentages for each faculty type in those years.To create a dot plot of these trends, I'll write a Python snippet using `matplotlib` and `seaborn` libraries to visualize the employment trends of instructional staff over time. Let's develop a complete Python code for this. The dot plot illustrates the trends in instructional staff employment from 1975 to 2011 across different faculty types.
