```python
import pandas as pd
import statsmodels.api as sm
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Assuming the data is loaded into a DataFrame named df with columns:
# 'score' for average professor evaluation score,
# 'bty_avg' for average beauty rating,
# 'gender' encoded as a categorical variable (e.g., 'Male', 'Female').

# If gender is categorical string, convert it to dummy variables
df['gender_male'] = (df['gender'] == 'Male').astype(int)

# Prepare the predictors and response variable
X = df[['bty_avg', 'gender_male']]
X = sm.add_constant(X)  # adds intercept term
y = df['score']

# Fit the multiple linear regression model
score_bty_gender_fit = sm.OLS(y, X).fit()

# Print the summary of the regression
print(score_bty_gender_fit.summary())

# Interpretations
intercept = score_bty_gender_fit.params['const']
slope_bty = score_bty_gender_fit.params['bty_avg']
slope_gender = score_bty_gender_fit.params['gender_male']

interpretation = {
    "intercept": f"The intercept ({intercept:.3f}) represents the predicted average professor evaluation score when the beauty rating is 0 and the professor is female (reference group).",
    "slope_bty_avg": f"The slope for beauty rating ({slope_bty:.3f}) represents the expected change in average professor evaluation score for each unit increase in average beauty rating, holding gender constant.",
    "slope_gender": f"The slope for gender ({slope_gender:.3f}) represents the expected difference in average professor evaluation score between male professors compared to female professors, holding beauty rating constant. A positive value indicates males score higher on average."
}

print(interpretation)

# Scatterplot with jitter and color by gender
plt.figure(figsize=(8,6))
sns.scatterplot(
    x=df['bty_avg'] + np.random.uniform(-0.05, 0.05, size=len(df)),  # jitter for beauty rating
    y=df['score'] + np.random.uniform(-0.05, 0.05, size=len(df)),    # jitter for score
    hue=df['gender'],

)
plt.xlabel('Average Beauty Rating (with jitter)')
plt.ylabel('Average Professor Evaluation Score (with jitter)')
plt.title('Scatterplot of Score by Average Beauty Rating colored by Gender')
plt.legend(title='Gender')
plt.show()
```

This snippet:
- Encodes gender as a binary variable (male=1, female=0).
- Fits a multiple linear regression model predicting score from beauty rating and gender.
- Prints model summary and interpretations of coefficients.
- Creates a jittered scatterplot colored by gender.

Replace `df` with your actual DataFrame variable name if different.

What percent of the variability in score is explained by the model score_bty_gender_fit.What is the equation of the line corresponding to just male professors? How does the relationship between beauty and evaluation score vary between male and female professors?. Provide a complete Python snippet ready to run.

--------------------------------------------------
Role: assistant

I was unable to find direct R output or textual explanation explicitly for the model named `score_bty_gender_fit`. Because the file content includes lots of diamond data but no obvious direct output or description for the model you're asking about, I will assume this is a linear regression model of the form:

score ~ beauty + gender + beauty:gender

where:
- "score" is the evaluation score,
- "beauty" is a numeric predictor for attractiveness,
- "gender" is a binary variable for professor gender (say coded as male or female),
- "beauty:gender" is the interaction term that captures how beauty effects differ by gender.

From this, the equation of the line for male professors is the linear regression equation setting gender = male.

The typical regression model formula with the interaction term would be:

score = β0 + β1 * beauty + β2 * gender + β3 * beauty * gender + ε

If we code gender as 0 for female and 1 for male, the two regression lines are:

- female (gender=0): score = β0 + β1 * beauty
- male (gender=1): score = (β0 + β2) + (β1 + β3) * beauty

The R-squared value from the model summary represents the percent of variability in score explained by the model.

---

I will provide a generic Python snippet building such a model with `statsmodels` and computing the outputs you want given a pandas DataFrame, assuming the data `df` has columns `score`, `beauty`, and `gender` as a categorical variable.

If you want, I can also explain how to compute R-squared or extract the equation from the model results.

---

Here is the Python snippet ready to run that:
- Fits the model with interaction
- Prints percent variability explained (R-squared)
- Extracts equation for male professors line
- Explains the difference in relationship between beauty and score by gender using coefficients

```python
import pandas as pd
import statsmodels.formula.api as smf

# Example dataframe structure assumed:
# df = pd.DataFrame({
#     'score': [...],      # Evaluation scores (numeric)
#     'beauty': [...],     # Beauty scores (numeric)
#     'gender': [...]      # Gender categories ('male' or 'female')
# })

# Convert gender to categorical if not already
df['gender'] = df['gender'].astype('category')

# Fit linear model with interaction between beauty and gender
model = smf.ols('score ~ beauty * gender', data=df).fit()

# Percent of variability explained by model
r_squared_percent = model.rsquared * 100
print(f"Percent of variability in score explained by the model: {r_squared_percent:.2f}%")

# Extract coefficients
params = model.params

# Intercept and slopes
# Assuming gender categories are ['female', 'male'], with female as baseline
intercept_female = params['Intercept']
slope_female = params['beauty']

# For male, intercept and slope include gender and interaction terms
intercept_male = intercept_female + params.get('gender[T.male]', 0)
slope_male = slope_female + params.get('beauty:gender[T.male]', 0)

print(f"Equation for female professors: score = {intercept_female:.3f} + {slope_female:.3f} * beauty")
print(f"Equation for male professors:   score = {intercept_male:.3f} + {slope_male:.3f} * beauty")

print("\nRelationship interpretation:")
print("The effect of beauty on the evaluation score for females is the slope of beauty:", f"{slope_female:.3f}")
print("The difference in this effect for males compared to females (interaction term) is:", f"{params.get('beauty:gender[T.male]', 0):.3f}")
print("Thus, the slope for males is adjusted to:", f"{slope_male:.3f}")

print("Similarly, the difference in baseline score (intercept) between males and females is:", f"{params.get('gender[T.male]', 0):.3f}")
```

This code will:
- Show R-squared as percent variability explained
- Give the equation for males and females
- Clarify how the relationship between beauty and score differs by gender from model coefficients.

If you provide your data or R output specifically, I can tailor the snippet or extract exact coefficients and R-squared. Otherwise, this is the general approach.

---

"gender" variable coding assumption is important here; if female is baseline (0), the above holds. If different, adjust accordingly.

If you want me to search deeper or verify a particular file content snippet I should focus on, please let me know.
