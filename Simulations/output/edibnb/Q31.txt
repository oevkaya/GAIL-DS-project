It seems there was still an issue reading the file. Since it's neither a standard CSV nor an Excel file, I'll attempt to open it using a more flexible library that can handle different data formats gracefully.

--------------------------------------------------
Role: assistant

It appears that I don't have access to the `pyexcel` library in this environment. Let's try reading the file using alternative methods or by examining its raw content to identify the format.

--------------------------------------------------
Role: assistant

The file is structured as a CSV with the following columns:

- `id`
- `price`
- `neighbourhood`
- `accommodates`
- `bathrooms`
- `bedrooms`
- `beds`
- `review_scores_rating`
- `number_of_reviews`
- `listing_url`

Now that we can see the structure, we can use this information to execute the request: finding the number of Airbnb properties located in "Old Town" with a one-night stay price greater than 100 GBP. I'll proceed with this task using the data.

--------------------------------------------------
Role: assistant

The dataset preview didn't contain any entries for "Old Town" properties with a price greater than 100 GBP. However, this preview is limited to the first 1000 characters of the file.

To ensure accurate results, let's read the entire CSV file and perform the filter and count again.

--------------------------------------------------
Role: assistant

There are 494 Airbnb properties located in "Old Town" with a one-night stay price greater than 100 GBP. 

If you need the complete Python code snippet for this operation, here it is:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the data from the file
file_path = 'your_file_path.csv'  # Replace with your actual file path
df = pd.read_csv(file_path)

# Filter for properties in "Old Town" with a price greater than 100 GBP
filtered_properties = df[(df['neighbourhood'] == 'Old Town') & (df['price'] > 100)]

# Count the number of such properties
num_properties_old_town_over_100 = len(filtered_properties)

print(num_properties_old_town_over_100)
```

This code will give you the number of properties in "Old Town" with a price exceeding 100 GBP when run with the complete data file.
