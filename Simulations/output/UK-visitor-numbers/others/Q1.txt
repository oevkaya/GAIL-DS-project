Which attraction had the most number of visitors in 2022?.Provide a complete Python snippet ready to run.

--------------------------------------------------
Role: assistant

To determine which attraction had the most number of visitors in 2022, I'll first need to inspect the contents of the uploaded file. Let's start by loading and examining the data.

--------------------------------------------------
Role: assistant

It seems that there is an issue with determining the file format automatically. This could be due to the file not being a standard Excel format, or it might be another type of file. Let's try loading the file with different engines or file-reading methods to identify the correct format.

--------------------------------------------------
Role: assistant

It seems the file is not in CSV format either, as no data was output. Let's try reading the file as a text file to see if it gives us any clues about its format.

--------------------------------------------------
Role: assistant

It seems there was no output from attempting to read the file as a text file. This suggests the file might be in a binary format or another non-text format. Let's try using a different approach to determine the file type.

--------------------------------------------------
Role: assistant

It seems that the file could not be read as an Excel file using the `openpyxl` engine either. This suggests the file might not be an Excel file. Let's try reading the file as a different type, such as a JSON or binary file.

--------------------------------------------------
Role: assistant

It appears that reading the file as a JSON file was also unsuccessful. Let's try using a binary reading method to see if we can identify the file type or extract any meaningful information.

--------------------------------------------------
Role: assistant

It seems that reading the file as a binary file did not provide any output either. This suggests that the file might be empty or corrupted. Could you please verify if the file you uploaded is correct and contains the expected data? If so, you might want to try uploading it again.
