--------------------------------------------------
Role: assistant

It seems that there was an issue reading the Excel file. This can happen with certain file types or formats. I'll attempt to load the file again by specifying an engine explicitly. Let's try reading it again with the appropriate settings.

--------------------------------------------------
Role: assistant

It seems there is a problem with reading the uploaded file as an Excel file, which could be due to the file format not being an Excel file or it being corrupted. Let's try a different approach by inspecting the file type to understand what kind of file we have here.

--------------------------------------------------
Role: assistant

It seems that the file type could not be determined from its extension, which suggests that the file might not be in a recognizable Excel format or might have a different structure, such as a CSV or a similar text format. Let me try reading the file as a CSV file to see if we can extract any data.

--------------------------------------------------
Role: assistant

It seems the file is not a CSV either. Since standard reading methods for Excel and CSV are not working, the file might have a unique format or might not be a standard spreadsheet or text-based file. 

Let's check if the file has a specific binary or plain text format to understand its contents.

--------------------------------------------------
Role: assistant

The contents of the file suggest that it is indeed a CSV file but without the typical `.csv` extension. Let's read the CSV data using the appropriate delimiter settings.

What are the mean and median visitor numbers in 2022 across all attractions? Also provide the Python code.

--------------------------------------------------
Role: assistant

Sure, let's first take a look at the data to understand its structure and determine how best to extract the visitor numbers for 2022. Then, we'll compute the mean and median visitor numbers for that year. Let's start by reading the data.

--------------------------------------------------
Role: assistant

It seems there was an issue determining the file format automatically. This can happen if the file extension is not typical for Excel files or if it's corrupt. Let's try specifying the Excel engine manually. 

I'll also check the file extension to determine the most suitable engine to use. Let's proceed with that.

--------------------------------------------------
Role: assistant

The file doesn't have an extension, which is likely causing issues with automatic detection. Let's assume it is an Excel file and specify an engine to read it. We'll try using the 'openpyxl' engine first.

--------------------------------------------------
Role: assistant

The file was successfully read using the 'openpyxl' engine. I'll now continue to compute the mean and median visitor numbers for 2022 across all attractions.

--------------------------------------------------
Role: assistant

It seems there was a misunderstanding because I didn't display the top of the dataframe successfully. Let me resolve this and inspect the data more correctly. Let's try reading the file again with the correct steps.

--------------------------------------------------
Role: assistant

It seems I was unable to display the data properly in the previous output, but now we are successfully prepared to inspect the first few rows to identify the necessary columns for computing the mean and median visitor numbers for 2022. 

Let's proceed with examining the columns to find those relevant to visitor numbers.

--------------------------------------------------
Role: assistant

It seems there was an error and the data wasn't retained from the previous steps. Let me read the file once more to ensure we have it properly loaded and visible to our references.

--------------------------------------------------
Role: assistant

It seems the file we are trying to read is not recognized as a valid Excel or zipped file format, which is often the result of the file not being properly formatted or corrupt. Let's switch approaches. 

I will attempt to read this file as a CSV, as it might have been incorrectly labeled. If this doesn't work, the file might be malformed beyond immediate repair.
Let's give it a try with CSV reading first.

--------------------------------------------------
Role: assistant

The CSV reading was successful. Let's now examine the first few rows and the columns to determine how best to proceed with calculating the mean and median visitor numbers for 2022. 

If any specific column names for visitor numbers are visible, we can identify them and continue our analysis. Let's take a look at this data.

--------------------------------------------------
Role: assistant

The dataset contains a column \( \text{'n\_2022'} \) that represents visitor numbers in 2022. I'll compute the mean and median of these visitor numbers for all attractions. Let's proceed with those calculations.
